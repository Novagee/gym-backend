	<p>To protect your own interests, please always abide by what you have agreed upon in the project agreement, and validate your counterparty when the project begins by entering your counterparty's validation code on the target project page.

The validation record will serve as important evidence should any dispute arise later.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
